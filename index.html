          <p>
            Electrolysis is the only FDA-approved 100% permanent hair removal
            method. Electrolysis eliminates hair from the root - unlike
            traditional hair removal methods, such as waxing, shaving, or
            plucking. Electrolysis works on all genders, skin tones, hair types,
            and tattoos - unlike laser hair removal which only targets dark
            hair, reduces hair growth, and causes distortion of body art.

                Clients are encouraged to ask questions and take photos of their
                progress. Since hair grows in unsynchronized cycles,
                electrolysis is usually a marathon not a sprint and it’s
                important to understand the process.
