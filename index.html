          <p>
            Electrolysis is the only FDA-approved 100% permanent hair removal
            method. Electrolysis eliminates hair from the root - unlike
            traditional hair removal methods, such as waxing, shaving, or
            plucking. Electrolysis works on all genders, skin tones, hair types,
            and tattoos - unlike laser hair removal which only targets dark
            hair, reduces hair growth, and causes distortion of body art.

                electrolysis is usually a marathon not a sprint and it important
                to understand the process.
